<p>The Labrador Retriever, also known simply as the Labrador or Lab,
    is a British breed of retriever gun dog. 
    It was developed in the United Kingdom from St.
     John's water dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland 
     (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador 
     region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs
     in several countries, particularly in the Western world.</p>
