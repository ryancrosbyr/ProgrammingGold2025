<p class = "para"> </p><strong>A puppy</strong> is a juvenile dog, generally one less than 12–18 months old.</p>

<p class = "para" id="puppy" style="background-color: blue;">Puppies are markedly underdeveloped and dependent on <br>their mothers at birth (displaying altriciality), but healthy puppies grow quickly and begin walking thereafter. Puppies generally weigh 250–450 grams (8–16 oz) shortly after birth, depending on the breed.[1]</p>

<p class = "para" id="puppy">A puppy's coat colour may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Puppy refers specifically to young dogs,[2] while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats, or sharks.[3]</p>
