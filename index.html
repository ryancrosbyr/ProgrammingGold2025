<p>A puppy is a juvenile dog, 
    generally one less than 12–18 months old </p>

<p > Hello this is programming gold. </p>

<p class = "para" id="puppy">Puppies are markedly 
    underdeveloped and dependent on <br>their mothers at birth 
    (displaying altriciality), but healthy puppies grow quickly and begin walking 
    thereafter. Puppies generally weigh 250–450 grams (8–16 oz) shortly after birth, 
    depending on the breed.[1]</p>

<p class = "para">A puppy's coat colour may change as the puppy grows older, 
    as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. 
    Puppy refers specifically to young dogs,[2] while pup may be used for other 
    animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats, or sharks.[3]</p>
